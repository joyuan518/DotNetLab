1. The solution contains 3 projects, which are:
      - "Trains.Main", the entry point of the application.
      - "Trains.Core", contains the core classes and interfaces to achieve the application functionalities.
      - "Trains.Test", the unit test projects for "Trains.Core".

   Please use Visual Studio 2015 to open the solution.
 
2. In "Trains.Core", I try to adopt some thoughts of OOD to make the application easy to modify and extend in the future.
   Add the cache support so that the application can cache its calculation results and return them faster in the next time.

   I have implemented all the functions that are required for the homework "Trains". 
   The concrete implementations you can find it in "Trains.Core\CalculatorsImplementations\DefaultCalculatorsImplementation.cs".
   
   I have added some necessary unit tests for each of the critical methods, but if time allowed, I'm going to add more.
 
3. You should be able to run this program in Visual Studio directly by press "F5", or run the built artifacts outside of it if you want.
   For now I haven't implemented using the input file to supply the application input data, but that won't take too long.

4. Planned to add better customized exception structure and system logging, but didn't get a chance to complete them.  

5. Sorry I spent sometime to review the theories and algorithm of the Graph, and that kind of delay the progress of the homework.
